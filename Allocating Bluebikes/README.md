Many large cities have urban bike-sharing systems playing vital roles in personal transportation. However,
their efficacy often gets undermined by bike misallocation. My teammates and I each have horror stories of 
finding no bikes available at a busy starting station, or perhaps even worse, there not being any open docks
left at the destination station by our arrival. Through modeling bike trips around Cambridge as a Markov 
process and simulating earnings, we developed a framework Bluebikes can use to optimize bike placement for 
maximal ride provision (and revenue generation).

I wrote the whole report and coded the revenue simulations. Ejike Ike and Marko Isakovic coded/wrote the rest
of the Jupyter notebook. Andrej Basica made the slides.

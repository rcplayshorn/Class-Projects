I love baseball. But, I don't love when human error in umpiring dictates game outcomes. In our 21st century world 
full of instant replays and nearly-perfect ball tracking, perhaps can help our umpires get better. Along with some 
buddies in Harvard's Intro to Data Science class, I set out to uncover the root causes (or, at least, covariates) of 
biased officiating to hopefully guide Blue on what they should look out for from behind the plate.

I wrote the code for data cleaning + feature engineering, the final few models, and initial explanations. Liam
Taylor drafted up the model pipeline and implemented the non-parametric models. John Russell carried out our EDA
and revised explanations of our observations. Rad Pelanis made the final slides and video.

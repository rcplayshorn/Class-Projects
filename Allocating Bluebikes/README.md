Many large cities have urban bike-sharing systems playing vital roles in personal transportation. However,
their efficacy often gets undermined by bike misallocation. My teammates and I each have horror stories of 
finding no bikes available at a busy starting station, or perhaps even worse, there not being any open docks
left at the destination station by our arrival. Through modeling bike trips around 
Cambridge as a Markov process and simulating earnings, we developed a framework Bluebikes can use to 
optimize bike placement for maximal ride provision.

I wrote the whole report and coded the revenue simulations for Ejike Ike and Marko Isakovic wrote most of the other code.
